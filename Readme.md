## About the Video Course
This course will help you to create an extensive, in-depth backend API for DevCamper, a Bootcamp directory app. You’ll learn how to deploy a professional API with documentation from the ground up.

The course starts with an overview of the project and an introduction to the HTTP essentials and Postman client. You’ll study HTTP status codes and how to send data to the server. The next section of the course will take you through the DevCamper project and show you how to create routes and responses in Express along with creating controller methods. As you make progress, you’ll learn how to create, fetch, and update and delete Bootcamps. You’ll also get to grips with the concepts of authentication, users, and permissions.

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to build a real-world backend RESTful API for a Bootcamp directory app and have learned about advanced Mongoose queries.
